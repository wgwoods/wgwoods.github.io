# System Upgrades
## past, present, and future

Will Woods &lt;wwoods@redhat.com&gt;

Installer Team engineer

---

## The one-slide version

* RPM upgrades are terrible
* `dnf system-upgrade` is the most sensible way to do them

---

## How system upgrades work

Two styles of upgrade: **Offline** and **Live**.

1. **Offline**: Upgrade process runs from outside the system
  * `anaconda`, `preupgrade`, `fedup`
2. **Live**: Upgrade process runs inside the running system
  * `apt-get dist-upgrade`, `yum`-based upgrades

,,,

### Offline: pro and con

* `+` Works without network (secure facilities, etc.)
* `+` Installer media can handle installs + upgrades
* `+` One download can upgrade many systems
* `+` System is offline (backup/restore, migrate filesystems, etc.)

* `-` Larger download than necessary
* `-` CD/DVD media is sloooowwwww
* `-` Still have to install updates after upgrade
* `-` **Difficult to correctly identify system to be upgraded**

,,,

### Live: pro and con

* `+` Easy to watch the upgrade in progress
* `+` Only download the packages needed for upgrade
* `+` One less reboot
* `+` Apply updates during upgrade

* `-` Can't migrate filesystems etc.
* `-` **Weird, complex bugs when you upgrade things in use**

---

## Olden times: `anaconda` upgrades

Just boot up the install CDROM!

* Download + burn all 5 CD images

~or~

* Boot `netinst.iso` and hope everything downloads OK!

---

## `anaconda` upgrades: they suck

* No updates
* Bad at finding the root partition
* Burnt media is unreliable and sloooowww
* Network upgrades: no wireless, crash if there's a bad mirror

---

## `preupgrade`: a weird hybrid

* download boot/installer images
* download all the packages *beforehand* (with updates!)
* set up system to boot `anaconda`, plus a kickstart
* reboot and upgrade!

---

### `preupgrade`: it also sucks

* Need to save boot images somewhere the bootloader can handle (like `/boot`)
* Still no guarantee that boot images can mount your disk(s)
* Makes the installer *even more* complicated
* Changing the bootloader is actually kind of unreliable

---

## `fedup`: a separate upgrade tool

* `dracut` initrd + code to handle upgrades = `upgrade.img`
    * only ~10MB!
* Add kernel+initrd using standard tool (`new-kernel-package`)
* Boot _new release's_ kernel + userspace
* Let _existing system_ set up disks like normal, then
* Switch _back_ to `fedup-dracut`, keeping disks mounted

---

## `fedup`: almost didn't suck

* `upgrade.img` bloats install images / trees
* Generic initrd can't always set up your system correctly
* The switch-back breaks `systemd` in horrible ways

---

## What's wrong with `fedup`?

* Python 2 only
* Uses `yum`, not DNF
* Doesn't always boot your system correctly
* Uses `systemd` in a _undocumented_, _unsupported_, and _broken_ way

---


## Enter `dnf system-upgrade`

* Basically just `dnf upgrade --releasever=23 --offline`
* `systemd` handles the "offline" bit for us
* `dnf` handles everything else

,,,

## `dnf system-upgrade`

* Python 2 + Python 3
* DNF plugin (`dnf-plugin-system-upgrade`)
* Doesn't touch your kernel/initrd
* Uses `systemd` [Offline Updates] (like `pk-offline-updates`)

on github: [rpm-software-management/dnf-plugin-system-upgrade]

[rpm-software-management/dnf-plugin-system-upgrade]: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
[Offline Updates]: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/

,,,

## But... migration??

Handle it like [UsrMove]

1. Write a `dracut` module (e.g. [`convertfs`])
2. Your module goes into the newly-built initrd
3. Migration happens at first boot after upgrade

[UsrMove]: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove
[`convertfs`]: https://github.com/haraldh/dracut/tree/044/modules.d/30convertfs

---

## `dnf system-upgrade`
### it.. almost doesn't suck

* Three kinds of problems:
  * `dnf` bugs
  * `dnf` plugin limitations
  * Everything Else about RPM

---

## RPM upgrades will always suck

This isn't what RPM was designed for.

* Insane amount of I/O
* Huge disk requirements
* RPM scriptlets are totally unpredictable
    * (time? disk? progress??)

---

## System Upgrades != Updates

Mostly the same code, but:

* Different user expectations (big changes! new code!)
* Different user experience (long time.. what's happening?)

---

## How could we do better?

* Better UI: switch progress screen
* More feedback (scriptlet progress)
* Snapshot before, restore on crash
* Notify user about problems

---

## Research: crazy-go-nuts!

### how else could we do this?

* Deploy /usr as an immutable image
* Apply binary diff to new root
* Atomic-style COW snapshot
* Other stuff - layering! Unionfs!

,,,

### how do other OSes handle this?

* OS X? Windows?
* iOS? Android?
* Other Linux distros? Atomic?
* Containers??
