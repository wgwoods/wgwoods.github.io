# weldr
### A post-packaging Linux distribution

Will Woods &lt;wwoods@redhat.com&gt;

---

## DISCLAIMERS

* Nothing in this talk is Official Red Hat Strategy, or representative of
  anything other than my own fevered imagination
* I wrote these slides 2 hours ago
* Welcome / forgive me

---

# The Gist

1. RPM isn't scaling well and it's costing huge 
2. We can fix it piece by piece; first we need to map out the pieces
3. 

---


## RPM-based systems aren't scaling well

* Number of _**source packages**_ grows exponentially
  * New GUIs, new languages, old stuff never goes away...
* Number of _**binary packages**_ grows exponentially
  * More subpackage splits, variant builds (py2/py3), more arches...
* _**Payloads**_ grow
  * New things get added, docs get longer, higher-quality artwork...
* _**Metadata**_ grows
  * New dependency types, more per-file data, changelogs
* _**Learning curve**_ grows
  * New packaging rules, more manual steps for builds / updates...

---

## "So what, disk is cheap!"

* We're growing faster than disks are getting cheaper
* Container workflows intensify the problem
* Modularity intensifies the problem
* Compression saves disk/bandwidth... at expense of CPU time

,,,

TODO: model & graph:

1. size of Fedora over time
2. price of disk over time, and extrapolate
3. total cost of using RPM-based system over time

---

## "Who cares if it takes a little while?"

* We can't do CI/CD, barely manage nightly builds
* Build/test cycles take days... or weeks
* These costs are passed on to _all users_
* _Millions of hours of developer time lost_

---

## "It's not _that_ complicated!"

* Nobody fully understands all of RPM anymore
* Packaging guidelines never catch up to Real Life
* We don't go back and fix old specfiles
* 15,000 specfiles [nc] and we're not sure what any of them do
* Every programming language environment invents its own packaging system
  * And they all get parts of it wrong!
* Docker/containers are popular because _they're easier than dealing with packaging_
  * `FROM fedora:latest` is faster and easier than building your own..
  * ...we cache each layer because installing packages is slow

_This is driving away developers and users_

---

_This is costing us and our users huge amounts of time and money_

---

## "That's just how things are!"

1. Problems arise from bad tradeoffs in the RPM ecosystem.
2. They are not inherent to the process of making a Linux distribution.
3. We can alleviate problems by designing improved solutions for each part of that process.
4. To fix this, we need to know what those parts are, and how they work.

---

## 1. Problems arise from bad tradeoffs in the RPM ecosystem.

,,,

1. Problem: RPM needs a new feature!
  * Solution: add some code and extra metadata to support it
  * Tradeoff: increases CPU / RAM / disk / bandwidth use
2. Problem: RPM uses too much CPU / RAM / disk / bandwidth!
  * Solution: some clever mitigation to reduce the most pressing factor
  * Tradeoff: increases cost of one (or more) of the others

_[repeat every 6 months for 20 years]_

,,,

* Every time we have a problem with RPM, we solve it by making RPM more complicated
* Every solution involves a tradeoff of some kind
* We don't know how these tradeoffs scale over time
* None of them are ever removed
* _Unforseen downsides eventually dominate all improvements._

---

## 2. They are not inherent to the process of making a Linux distribution.

,,,

1. How much of each package build is actually spent in `%build`?
2. How much of the metadata downloaded is actually used when finding updates?
3. How much data in downloaded updates is different than what's already on disk?
4. How much of a system install is actually spent copying files to disk?
5. How much time during a system upgrade is actually spent installing new versions of files?

,,,

Answers:

1. (No good data on this; it's hard to get this from koji, which is its own problem)
2. Dependency metadata makes up about 2.3% of all metadata
3. 75-90% of data shipped in updates is unchanged from GA (varies by release)
4. weldr's prototype exporter built system images in <2% of the time of a normal install
5. Atomic system updates generally take <1% of the time (TODO run tests to back this up)

_(TODO: publish & link to tools/data that gathered these numbers)_

,,,

**90-99%** of all common operations is wasted overhead.

_We pass this waste on to customers._

_They want a better way._

---

## 3. We can alleviate problems by designing improved solutions for each part of that process.

,,,

* It's Open Source, y'all
* Maintainers will help because they all want this to work better
  * Scriptlet reform efforts have been enthusiastic
* Users & operators will switch to new systems if there's compelling advantages
  * Look at adoption of Docker, `git`, etc.
* Designing a new system does not mean destroying the old one
  * RPM isn't going anywhere, it will all keep working
* We can build systems with legacy support to help people transition
  * like `systemd` and SysV initscripts

NOTES:
Yo, these are my speaker notes.

---

## 4. To fix this, we need to know what those parts are, and how they work.

,,,

## "Can't we just fix RPM?"

How??

* No specifications, no format versioning, no stable API
* We can't remove or replace anything without breaking the world
* We can only add extra layers of code/metadata outside RPM
* This is why we're having problems scaling in the first place

---

## So what's the plan?

1. Map out the components of the RPM ecosystem
  * Pay attention to _why_ each piece is there!
2. Design and build better solutions for each piece, one by one
  * Ensure each piece is either backward-compatible or opt-in
  * Also ensure each piece is well-documented and extensible
3. Move away from legacy workflows when possible
4. Hooray, we built a new system without burning it all down

---

## 1. Map out the components of the RPM ecosystem

(TODO: drawing of the Build Loop, details on each piece)

,,,

## RPM-centered view

1. RPM macros
  * **Build Options**
2. Source RPM: tarball, patches, spec
  * **Sources**, **Component Metadata**, **Build Instructions**
3. Koji: builds & buildroots
  * **Build Environment**, **Build Logs**, **Build Metadata**
4. Binary RPM: headers & payload
  * payload: **Build Artifacts**, **Artifact Metadata**
  * headers: **Signatures**, **Dependency Metadata**, **Changelog**
5. Yum/DNF Repository: RPMs + repodata
  * reformatted metadata, **Metadata Indexes**

---

## Rebuild it all, one piece at a time

(TODO: format like a tech tree :D)

* Fix package install scriptlets
* New **Binary Artifact** repo
* New formats for **Build Instructions** and **Dependency Metadata**
* New **Source** repositories

,,,

TODO: go one-by-one through the pieces, examine problems (inefficiency,
complexity, inflexibility), then propose other solutions

---

## Fix scriptlets

* They need to be _well-behaved_, if not _deterministic_

---

## Binary Artifact Repo

* Directory full of RPMs
  * Size grows exponentially
  * Attempt to control size with heavy compression..
  * This adds time/CPU overhead to every package installation!
